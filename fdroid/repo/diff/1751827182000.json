With these markers in the waveform, you can remember them and easily jump back to them.\n\nWant to know the track id of a specific part in a mix? SoundCrowd comes with build-in audio tagging support by using SongRec, an open-source Shazam client implementation, and creates cue points for found track ids. Unlike Shazam, the app records the internal audio of the player, so you don't need to grant access to the microphone or play the music loud!\n\nThe app contains build-in plugin modules to support the following online streaming services:\n- SoundCloud\n- YouTube\n- Spotify\n- Beatport\n- Tidal"}, "icon": {"en-US": {"name": "/com.tiefensuche.soundcrowd/en-US/icon_IwQg_rmg0aRc4U_BCgdJkA_xo1RjFP2z8adhuPr9r6Y=.png", "sha256": "230420feb9a0d1a45ce14fc10a0749900ff1a3546314fdb3f1a761b8fafdafa6", "size": 3037}}}}, "com.tiefensuche.soundcrowd.plugins.spotify": {"metadata": {"preferredSigner": "3869729aa4c9496ceb9ca259d53c06e1eb55c36d49afaf27453f086079882508"}}}}
