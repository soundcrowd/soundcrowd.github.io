## SoundCrowd music player for Android

SoundCrowd is a free, open-source and lightweight music player for Android in modern material design, specialized for playing long music tracks (DJ mix, live sets, audio books).

SoundCrowd features the generation of waveforms that visualize your music tracks during playback and can be used for precise seeking through gestures.

SoundCrowd lets you create cue points at your favorite positions in your music tracks. With these markers in the waveform, you can remember them and easily jump back to them.

SoundCrowd can be extended via plugin modules to support various online streaming services.
